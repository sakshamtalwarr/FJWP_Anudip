# FJWP Anudip - Learning Repository (WILL KEEP UPDATING THIS REPO AS I AM STILL ON MY LEARNING JOURNEY!)

Welcome to my **FJWP Anudip** learning repository! This is where I document my progress, assignments, and projects as I go through the **Fundamentals of Java and Web Programming** course at **Anudip Foundation**.

## 📚 About the Course

I have been enrolled in the **17-week Fundamentals of Java and Web Programming** course for two weeks now. The course covers essential programming and web development skills, including:

- **Core Java 8** (OOP concepts, data structures, exception handling, multithreading)
- **Database & MySQL** (SQL queries, database management)
- **DevOps** (Git, SonarQube, Maven, Jenkins)
- **JPA with Hibernate 3.0**
- **Web Development** (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, TypeScript)
- **Agile & SCRUM** methodology
- **Soft Skills Training** for professional development
